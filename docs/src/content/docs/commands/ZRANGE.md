The elements are considered to be ordered from the lowest to the highest score.
Both start and stop are 0-based indexes, where 0 is the first element, 1 is the next element and so on.
These indexes can also be negative numbers indicating offsets from the end of the sorted set, with -1 being the last element of the sorted set, -2 the penultimate element and so on.
